    <p>
      I've been playing basketball for more than half my life and I still can't
      get enough of it. I can thank my stepdad for this passion as he taught me
      everything about the game. The sport itself even brought my family
      together. My mom plays, my cousins and my uncle, and we would regularly
      have games or just shoot around as a family. Even to this day watch
      basketball and am mesmerized by the athleticism of these athletes and how
      much fun it looks to play at an elite level.
